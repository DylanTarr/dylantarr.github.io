                <em>This interview was originally published in City Pulse. Due to formatting issues it has also published it here. The original can be viewed here.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
               Chris Farren’s 2016 record “Can’t Die” is a year old now, not only surviving, but thriving. To celebrate, the pop-tinged rock-and-roller hit the road. Before playing at Mac’s Bar this Saturday, Farren spoke with City Pulse about the album, staying genuine and admitting that he will almost certainly die someday. 
            </p>    
            <p>
                <b>How has a year changed “Can’t Die” for you?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                It makes me hear the songs differently while I’m playing them. And seeing the way people react to certain songs gives me a different perspective on them. There’s a song on the record called “Human Being,” and as is the case with many songs I write, I wrote it and thought, “This is the way I feel. I can’t imagine anybody else in the world feeling like this.” But that seems to be a song that a lot of people like. That obviously makes me feel very good and like I wasn’t a prick [laughs].
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Was mortality a subject you were grappling with while writing “Can’t Die”?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                To say the lyrics on <em>High Concept</em> are relatable is an understatement. They're more than relatable, they're thoughts that have been kicking around your head for the last few years of your life. And just as they started to materialize in your brain, Charles Rogers beats you to the punch and puts all of them on a record.
            </p>
            <p>
                Is everything binary? Can it all be split into "good" and "bad"? Charles Rogers doesn't know either and that's what makes "Car Crash While Hitchhiking" so appealing. Cawthon belts out the line, "this is water, and this is trash/and I'm trying to split the gap," unabashedly parsing the boundaries between right and wrong, giving and taking while simultaneously revealing an incestuous relationship between the two.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cawthon sings, "better put passing judgment on the cover of your resume," before asking, "is anybody keeping score?" and accepts that the world isn't black and white, that transactions within any relationship just lead to a deserving sense of expectation that always ends up being self-defeating.
            </p>
            <p>
                Charles Rogers wrangle with grief in "50 Push Ups" when Cawthon growls, "do you think that it's wrong to talk about it so much?/we've got nothing new to say," exhausting over constant self-temperature-taking and metal reassessment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Appalled by onlookers expecting grief to be insultingly digestible, Cawthon sings, "they need a measurement, to compare you with/don't you feel their eyes on the back of your head?"
            </p>
            <p>
                I could go on and dissect every song, but that's where the fun is, and besides, that's your job.
            </p>
            <p>
                Charles Rogers are the band we need right now. Heavy and engaging without sacrificing intelligence, introspective without wasting time self-obsessively waxing poetic. On <em>High Concept</em>, Charles Rogers talks about emotion in a way that avoids the cyclical, roundabout path that a lot of music takes us on. Charles Rogers avoids lateral change and substitutes in upward growth instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, no, I'm not "ready to get sad," and neither are Charles Rogers. I'm ready for an album with monolithic guitars, paint-peeling bass, drums that sound like they were recorded in the Titanic, and sprouting, sprawling lyrics that Don DeLillo only wishes he wrote. I'm ready for <em>High Concept</em> and so are you.
